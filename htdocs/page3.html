                Hello! Welcome to the "Context" section where I try to talk about what this series of webpages actually is. The Museum Unintelligible (formerly the Museum Unintelligable, 'cause I forget how to spell) is an html project with the purpose of entertainment by using 6-panel comics, secret codes, a pinch of nonsense imagery, and a dollop of subliminal messages, all oven-cooked at a temperature of 177 degrees Celsius for 45 minutes, before being flavoured with a bit of pretentiousness, agony, and unconditional love. Anyways, I should actually start talking about the website in a less gibberish-esque way.
                <br><br>
                <span style="color: goldenrod">
                The title image seen above was made in September 2020 to fit the theme of weirdness and strangeness that is to be the theme of everything else. It shows the color scheme of black, gold, silver, and flourescent pink, and also involves a metallic triangular panel bolted onto the "U", inspired by conspiracy nonsense like the Illuminati (it's clickable, if you haven't tried yet). To the left is a bunch of useless images I added to continue the theme. The word "Xwzaovem" has been vigenere ciphered along with some other texts here and there. You can probably brute force it with some websites. To the right are some social media links, and below are some scrolling text, mostly gibberish, references, and codes. That part was inspired by a similar feature from the internet game, Blaseball.
                </span>
                <br><br>
                <span style="color: darkgrey">
                For the menu, there are the links to the different pages with some cool background-changing div's (at least, in my opinion). Then, there are the comics, which have a time-travely theme. This is because, as I'm making this, I'm also writing something else involving time-travel, which is going terribly. For this page, I've put in some images on what the website looks like from my perspective. You may also notice the black fading screen which was added to hide any "transition" css (but it also just makes navigating look smoother). 
                </span>
                <br><br>
                I mentioned some subliminal messages and I've actually created some, in fact, this is the only page, except the menu, where they don't play automatically (that's a lie, there's some ComSci quotas to fill). This is so you can play them yourself (I increased their volumes). If you wanna actually know what they're saying, you have to do your own sound editing. The websites I used to make these are listed in the next page, wherein you could work backwards in order to get the original sounds. I added these in because I like the idea that people once believed that this was enough to mind-control people. ALSO, THINK OF THE THEME, AND THE SPOOKS IT BRINGS!
